# Liver-lesion-classification
Liver lesion classification with extra trees (extra random forest)


Features are calculated with matlab scripts and classifier is trained using Python 2.7 and sci-kit learn.

The feature values are saved in an excel file and extracted from dynamic contrast enhanced MRI and T2-weighted MRI of the abdomen.

The script should be adjusted for personal use, i.e. change directories and supply own data.
